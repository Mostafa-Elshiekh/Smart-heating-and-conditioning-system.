# smart-heating-and-conditioning-system
The project, in short, it is smart heating and conditioning system..first, the temperature sensor detects the air temperature and sells it to the Analog digital converter
And then microcontrollers (AVR-Atmega32) treat the temperature and print it on the LCD
1- If the air temperature is 20 or less, turn on the heater and light up the RED LED as an alarm and display it on the LCD of this Heater Mood.
2- If the air temperature is 30 ° or more, the heater and alarm are disconnected from the Red Led and turn on the Blue LED as an alarm and display that this is
Air conditioner mood.
3- If the air temperature is from 20 °: 30 °, the heater and air conditioning green LED will be disconnected as an alarm and it is displayed on the LCD that this is the default mood and so on.
